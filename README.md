pretty sure all you need to run most of this is the stuff that comes with an installation of ROOT using conda. But just in case:

`
import sys
import ROOT as RT
import awkward as ak
from coffea.nanoevents import NanoEventsFactory, DelphesSchema
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as ss
import pprint
`
